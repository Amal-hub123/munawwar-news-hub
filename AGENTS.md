# Project decisions

- Apply the bounded public canvas and its track-padding overrides only at CSS viewport widths of at least 2560px; leave ordinary desktop shells untouched because viewport width is reliable but browser zoom detection is not.

- Keep timeline selection in scoped RTL text tabs using the shared Button, with a gold active underline; styling changes must preserve the existing selected timeline and content rendering.
- Render image timelines at full container width with intrinsic height and no image hover transform, so every image stays fully visible independently of viewport height.

- Reserve vertical motion clearance inside animated horizontal tracks and use unclipped reveal transitions; scroll containers must not cut off floating cards, while intentional image-frame zoom and decorative cropping stay scoped.

- Apply the shared internal-page canvas at the document and top-level page shells, excluding shells containing the editorial homepage; transparent services sections expose this canvas without altering cards, reader-selected backgrounds, or homepage artwork.

- Keep archive card styling opt-in through ArticleCard's archive variant; shared heading CSS targets public page and section titles, excluding card titles, editor content, and admin/writer management screens to preserve hierarchy.

- Anchor hero decorative circles to the article artwork with percentage-based positions and square aspect ratios; this preserves the same composition across screen sizes.

- Keep the three core services as presentation content in the public Services page; database services remain the independently managed “خدمات أخرى” list, preserving the existing editorial workflow.
- Article detail pages use the scoped `.article-editorial` reading layout; service detail pages render only their uploaded ServiceGallery using the column-gallery presentation classes, keeping stored service content and editing workflows intact while matching the visual columns.
- ProductDetail uses a shared article gallery only for the image and quote columns, normalizing Arabic diacritics when matching their names; other columns retain their existing article lists and all content stays in the existing article workflow.
- Service and visual-column galleries share an Embla image track for mouse and touch navigation; service frames follow intrinsic image proportions while column image links retain click navigation and suppress accidental clicks after dragging.
